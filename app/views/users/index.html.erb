		<p id="about-site">A deployment can be tough on everyone involved, but one way to make long months shorter is by keeping busy. A Few Short Miles is a an app created for family and friends of a deployed loved one in the military. Users sign up, join a team made up of users on their own home base who are currently starting the same deployment, and collectively keep track of how many miles they run, bike, swim, or walk each day.  Each team’s goal is to reach the number of miles between their home base and the location of their loved one’s deployment.
		<br>
		<br>
		Not only does A Few Short Miles benefit your physical health and fitness, but exercising also helps keep your mental state stable, which can be vital when working your way through a deployment. Not only that, but you're connecting with other men and women waiting for their loved ones to return, too.</p>
